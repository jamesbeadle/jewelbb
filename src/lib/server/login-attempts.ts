/**
 * Brute-force protection for /admin/login.
 *
 * Every attempt is written to Supabase (public.admin_login_attempts —
 * created by supabase/2026-09-04-security-hardening.sql). Before a
 * password is even checked, the server counts that IP's recent
 * failures; once MAX_FAILURES have happened inside WINDOW_MINUTES the
 * IP is refused until the oldest of them ages out of the window.
 * Keeping the log in the database (rather than in memory) means the
 * limit holds across Vercel's serverless instances and redeploys.
 *
 * Fails soft on purpose: if Supabase is unreachable or the table has
 * not been created yet, the problem is logged and login still works —
 * the password stays the primary control and the admin is never locked
 * out by an outage. Only the IP, the username tried and the outcome are
 * stored; passwords never are.
